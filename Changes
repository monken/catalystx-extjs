Revision history for CatalystX-ExtJS

2.1.2  2011-02-09
  - more prereqs
  - tutorial fix

2.1.1  2011-02-06
  - Fixed prereqs to include example and tutorial prereqs

2.1.0  2011-02-05
  - CatalystX::ExtJS has been split up in CatalystX::ExtJS::Direct and
    CatalystX::ExtJS::REST. Installing this module will pull in both of
    them, so nothing changes for you. The benefit is that you can use
    CatalystX::ExtJS::Direct without installing CatalystX::ExtJS and
    the prereqs for CatalystX::ExtJS::REST, which include DBIx::Class 
    and HTML::FormFu.
